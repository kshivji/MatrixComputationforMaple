# MatrixComputationforMaple
Collection of files, procedures, and worksheets related to matrix computation using Maple (CAS).

  The code in this repository is related to some of the research that I was lucky enough to participate in during my undergraduate degree at Simon Fraser University. Under the supervision of Dr. Michael Monagan, I worked as a research assistant studying computer algebra. More specifically, we were interested in trying to improve determinant computation techniques. Using the software package Maple, we experimented with a number of different methods trying to optimize existing solutions, or develop a new one ourselves. Along the way, we produced many short pieces of code that acted as the foundation of different optimizations and experiments. I thought it would be nice to share what came of this process, so feel free to take what you like! Whenever I have the time, I will try to add more files to bolster the functionality of what is already here.
  
  Given that Maple is not free, I understand that not everyone has access to it. In the (hopefully) near future, I plan on writing some of the procedures in other languages such as C/C++ and Matlab so that a wider audience can use them. If you are interested in learning more about Maple, you can do so here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_(software).
  
 Thanks for stopping by,
